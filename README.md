This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop within the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, where the `setCount` function is called inside the useEffect hook without proper dependency management, leading to an infinite loop.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code, demonstrating how to resolve this issue. This is a crucial concept in React development to ensure performance and prevent unexpected behavior.
